# Concept
This class portal will present the design journal and the code of my projects, along with links to my linkedin profile and personal portfolio on main navigation for career purposes.
Each project would display as cards.
Each card would lead to its own project page with a 1-2 paragraph introduction and the finished project, with links to its design journal and code hosted on github.

# Theme
**The style of the portal should have the following properties:**
- Fun yet easy-to-navigate
- Modern yet formal
- Accessible
- Responsive for most screen sized and browsers

**To achieve these properties, this portal will at least have:**
- Some animations or graphic elements
- Card view of all projects with single-line introduction
- Modern, formal typography
- Bold, high-contrst color palette
- Collapsible navigation menu
- Responsive images
- Custom layout
